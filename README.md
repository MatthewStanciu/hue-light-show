A psychedelic light show with Philips Hue bulbs

Currently just playing around with the Philips Hue API and seeing what it's like to control my lights with code. In its current state, it just makes each bulb a random color every 3 seconds, which I feel produces more of a "gamer setup" effect rather than a psychedelic effect. I want to remove a little bit of the randomness and add some sort of synchronization.

Ideally, this would sync to music and pull colors from sound analyzation and album covers.
